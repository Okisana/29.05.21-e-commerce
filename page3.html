                    covers the torso and hangs down over the legs. A dress can be any one-piece garment containing a skirt of any length, and can be formal or casual. A dress can have sleeves, straps, or be held up with elastic around the chest, leaving
                    the shoulders bare. Dresses also vary in color. The hemlines of dresses vary depending on modesty, weather, fashion or the personal taste of the wearer.

                <p class="p3">In the early twentieth century, the look popularized by the Gibson Girl was fashionable. The upper part of women's dresses in the Edwardian era included a "pigeon breast" look that gave way to a corseted waist and an s-shaped silhouette.
                    Women called their dresses "waists" if one-piece, or "shirtwaists," if it consisted of a skirt and a blouse. The bodice of the dresses had a boned lining. Informally, wealthy women wore tea gowns at home. These garments were looser,
                    though not as loose as a "wrapper," and made of expensive fabric and laces. By 1910, the Edwardian look was replaced with a straighter silhouette. French designer, Paul Poiret, had a huge impact on the look of the time.[44] Designs
                    developed by Poiret were available in both boutiques and also in department stores.
                </p>
                <p class="p3"></p>Popular dresses of the time were one-piece and included lingerie dresses which could be layered. At around the same time, in the United States, the American Ladies Tailors' Association developed a dress called the suffragette suit,
                which was practical for women to work and move around in.Another innovation of the 1910s was the ready availability of factory-made clothing.[49] Waistlines started out high and by 1915 were below the natural waist. By 1920, waistlines
                were at hip-level. Between 1910 and 1920 necklines were lower and dresses could be short-sleeved or sleeveless. Women who worked during World War I preferred shorter dresses, which eventually became the dominant style overall. In addition
                to the shorter dresses, waistlines were looser and the dominant colors were black, white and gray.
